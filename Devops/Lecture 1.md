### Introduction to Devops


- **Software Development Life Cycle:**

    1. Planning:
        1. Feasibility Study
        2. Requirement Analysis
    2. Design
    3. Coding/Implementation
    4. Testing
    5. Deployment
    6. Maintenance


- **What is Agile?**

    * Agile is a **Mindset**, defined by **Values**, guided by **Principles**, and demonstrated by **Practices**.
        1. **Mindset**: Mindset is intrinsic to how we approach things.
        2. **Values**: Core values are the cornerstone by which we ensure we stay on the correct path.
        3. **Principles**: Agile principles provides the guidance on goals and behavior.
        4. **Practices**: Practices are a set of actions designed to achieve business outcome.


- **Devops:**

    * Devops is an abbreviation of **Development** and **Operations**.

    * Devops Methodology: 
        1. Continuous Integration
        2. Continuous Testing
        3. Continuous Deployment
        4. Continuous Operations
        5. Continuous Monitoring

- **Containerization:**

    * Create small containers

    * Containers: 

- Hypervisor
- VirtualMshine

- **Software Delivery Pipeline:**

    * Developer --(Continuous Development)--> Version Control System --> Continuous Integration --(Continuous Testing)--> Production Server & Test Server --(Continuous Monitoring)--> Developer

- **Continuous Monitoring Tools:**
    1. Stack
    2. Nagios
    3. Splunk>

- **Docker Architecture:**
    
    * Components:
        1. Docker Client
        2. Docker Daemon
        3. Docker Images
        4. Containers
        5. Docker Hub

    * Stages:
        1. Build: Create an image.
        2. Ship: Share images via Docker Hub.
        3. Run: Start containers.

    * Container States:
        1. Created
        2. Running
        3. Paused
        4. Stopped
