### Introduction to Cloud Fundamentals

- Contents:
    1. Introduction to Cloud Computing
    2. Characteristics, Roots
    3. Delivery Models:
        * IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
    4. Cloud Deployment Models:
        * Public, Private, Hybrid and Communnity Cloud

- Community Cloud:
    * Example: Github, Facebook.
    * Community uploading their personal details or works but not projects/accolades.

- Cloud Computing Services can be accessed from:
    1. Server 
    2. Storage 
    3. Mobile 
    4. Applications 
    5. Database

- Types of Cloud Deployment Models:
    1. Private
    2. Public
    3. Hybrid

> *In job/internship start, it will not start with projects but training.*

- What do you mean by Cloud Computing?
    * Simple Definition: It is computing resources provided to the user via cloud in the region assigned. In this cloud, it is like there are pools of components.
    * Gartner's definition: "*Cloud Computing is a style of computing where massively scalable IT-related capabilities are provided as a service across the Internet to multiple external customers*". {Consolidated}
    * Forrester's definition: "*Cloud Computing is a pool of abstracted, highly scalable, and managed infrastructure capable of hosting end-customer applications and billed by consumption*". {Consolidated}
    * Wikipedia's definition: "*Cloud Computing is a web-based processing, whereby shared resources, software, and information are provided to computers and other devices (such as smartphones) demand over the Internet*". {Not Consolidate}
    * Rajkumar Buyya's definition: "**".

- Cloud Computing Characteristics:
    1. Rapid Elasticity & Scalability
    2. Automation
    3. Security
    4. Pay As You Go
    5. Measured Service
    6. Budget-Friendly
    7. Broad Network Access
    8. On-Demand Self-Service
    9. Easy Maintenance
    10. Resource Pooling

> Maximum Threshold is 80% for when scaling starts.

- Interview Questions: Two types of Scaling?
    * Answer: Vertical (Scaling up the hardware) & Horizontal (Scaling based on requirements temporarily).

> If aiming for Cloud Security role, Computer Networks and IP-related concepts should be clear.

- CIDR.xyz provides complete details on IP Address.

- Advantages:
    1. Lower Computational Cost
    2. Improved Performance
    3. Reduced Software Cost
    4. Instant Software Updates
    5. Unlimited Storage Capacity
    6. Increased Data Reliability
    7. Device Independence
    8. Free From Maintenance And The "No-Need-To-Know"

- Cloud Types & Its Layers:
    1. Service Types:
        a.  SaaS
        b.  PaaS
        c.  IaaS
    2. Main Access & Management Tool:
        a. Web Browser
        b. Cloud Development Environment
        c. Virtual Infrastructure Manager
    3. Service Content:
        a. Cloud Applications (Social Networks, Office Suites, CRM, Video Processing)
        b. Cloud Platform (Programming Languages, Frameworks, Mashups Editors, Structured Data)
        c. Cloud Infrastructure (Compute Servers, Data Storage, Firewall, Load Balancers)
