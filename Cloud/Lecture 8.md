- **Infrastructure as a Code (IaC)**
    * Infrastructure Management - *Traditional Way*
        - Traditionally infrastructure was configured manually.
        - Scripts (Platform Specific)
        - Graphical User Interface
        - Manual configuration would pose below challenges:
            1. Scalability
            2. Consistency depends on accuracy of manual configuration
            3. Configuration Drift
            4. Difficult to document
            5. Difficult to keep multiple environments in lockstep
        - Infrastructure Management - *Through Code (IaC)*
            + Above challenges can be addressed through IaC.
            + IaC allows us to conffigure infrastructure rogrammatically through code.

        - **Definition:** IaC is a process of provisioning, managing, and configuring various resources in computer infrastructure through machine-readable configuration files, rather than through physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.

        - **Features of IaC:**
            + Codify infreastructure provisioning
            + Version control infrastructure
            + Consistency
            + Speed
            + Facilitate cost savings
            + Single source of truth
            + Accountability
            + Team Collaboration (CI)
            + CI/CD Pipelines
            + Simplify, Standardize and Scale (SSS) with ease
            + Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
