### Containers


- Docker Benefits:
    1. Consistent and isolated environments
    2. Fast deployment
    3. Repeatability and automation
    4. Supports Agile and CI/CD Devops practices
    5. Versioning for easy testing, rollbacks and redeployments
    6. Collaboration, modularity and scaling
    7. Easy portability and flexibility.


- Challenging Use Cases:

    Docker is not a good fit for applications:
    1. Requiring high performance or security
    2. Based on Monolith architecture.
    3. Using rich GUI features
    4. Performing standard desktop or limited functions.


- Docker container creation Process:

    Steps to create and run containers:
    1. Create a Dockerfile
    2. Use the Dockerfile to create a container image.
    3. Use the container image to create a running container.
